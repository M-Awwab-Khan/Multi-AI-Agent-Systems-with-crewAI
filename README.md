# Multi-AI-Agent-Systems-with-crewAI
Automate business workflows with multi AI agent systems

## Goal
Designing effective AI agents and organize team of AI agents them to perform complex, multi-step tasks.

## Key Components of Multi-agent system
<ul>
  <li><b>Role:</b> Assign specialized role to agents</li>
  <li><b>Memory:</b> Provide agents with short-term, long-term and shared memory</li>
  <li><b>Tools:</b> Assign pre-built and custom tools to each agent (eg. for web search)</li>
  <li><b>Focus:</b> Break down task, goals and tools and assign multiple AI agents for better performance</li>
  <li><b>Guardrails:</b> Effectively handle errors, hallucinations and infinite loops.</li>
  <li><b>Cooperation:</b> Perform tasks in series, in parallel and hierarchical fashion</li>
</ul>

## crewAI
Framework for building multi-agent systems (that are autonomous, role-playing and collaborate)
<br>
crew : Team of AI agents working together, each with a specific role.

## Applications of multi-agent systems.
<ul>
  <li>Resume Strategist : Tailor resumes and interview prep</li>
  <li>Design, build and test website</li>
  <li>Research, write and fact-check technical papers</li>
  <li>Automate customer support inquiries</li>
  <li>Conduct social media campaigns</li>
  <li>Perform financial analysis</li>
</ul>

## What is Agentic Automation
New way to write software. Provide fizzy inputs, apply fuzzy tranformations and get fuzzy outputs.

Reason why people love chatGPT: <b>Probablistic nature</b>

## How Agentic Automation improves regular automation

### Regular Automation (Regular Data Collection and Analysis)

- Capture information about the company
- Use classification to generate scores for company
- Prioritise for sales

### Agentic Automation (Data Collection and Analysis using crew)

- AI agent research about company (via Google, internal database)
- AI agent compares companies (new ones, old ones)
- AI agent scores companies (based on parameters)
- AI agent provides intelligent questions to ask based on scores

## Why AI Agents better than LLMs
#### LLMs 
Provide human feedback iteratively to fine-tune response</li>

#### AI Agents
When LLMs operate autonomously, they become agents. AI Agents ask and answer questions on its own.

LLMs +  Cognition = AI Agents.

#### Supercharge AI Agents with Tools
AI Agents use built-in and custom tools to perform tasks (calling API, posting online, gathering data)

## Why Multi AI Agents rather single agent 

<ol>
  <li>Assign specific role and specific task to each agent and improved output. Eg. One agent does exhaustive research and other does professional writing.</li>
  <li>Use different LLMs for specific tasks</li>
</ol>
